## Title
Assessing Life Expectancy and Healthcare Access in the Americas: A Comparative Analysis of Brazil and the USA

## Main Question
Does healthcare access impact life expectancy in the Americas, specifically between the USA and Brazil?

## Description
Healthcare access is a critical pillar in shaping health outcomes, such as life expectancy, which is a key measure of public health in societies.  This project analyzes the impact of healthcare access on life expectancy in the Americas, focusing on a comparison between the USA and Brazil. Statistical analysis and visualization techniques are used on the tabular data to examine different factors like immunization rates, density of doctors and nurses, and the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index.
This analysis aims to reveal patterns that connect healthcare access with life expectancy outcomes.  The results can provide valuable insights into the disparities between two healthcare systems and the influence of public health in different geographic contexts.
